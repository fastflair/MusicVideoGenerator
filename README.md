# ðŸ›‘ FAQS:

## What does it do?

- This program cleverly assembles your previously downloaded scaffold videos into a tempo synced music video based on a provided input song and bpm

## How does it do it?

1. Analyses a .wav file (located in music/)
2. Generates 3 seperate tempo and dynamically synced music videos out of random .mp4 videos located in videos/
3. Combines them through the use of overlay FX into one video located in output/ 
4. Applies chroma shifting to the final product to make the videos bleed into eachother for contrast.  

## What does "dyamically synced" mean?

- Louder sections of your input song have a higher chance of faster / more intense visuals and vice versa.

## What does it not do?

- Generate music videos from thin air.

## Where can I find sample videos to use?
